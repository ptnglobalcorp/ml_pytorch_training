# Module 1: Infrastructure & Prerequisites

**Build your dev environment with Docker, AWS, and Terraform**

## Quick Start

1. **Read the conceptual guides** in this folder
2. **Practice with labs** in [`../../module-01/`](../../module-01/)

```
Learn:  docs/module-01/         →  Theory and concepts
Do:     module-01/terraform/    →  Hands-on Terraform practice
        module-01/aws/          →  AWS service practice with LocalStack
```

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand containerization concepts and Docker fundamentals
- Understand AWS core services for ML workloads
- Implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Practice AWS services locally using LocalStack

- [Storage & Database Practice](aws/localstack/storage-database.md)
- [Networking & Analytics Practice](aws/localstack/networking-analytics-security.md)

### Step 2: Terraform Infrastructure as Code

**Read:**
- [Terraform Basics Guide](terraform/basics.md) - Complete reference
- [Terraform Examples](terraform/examples.md) - Hands-on examples
- [Terraform Exercises](terraform/exercises.md) - Practice exercises

**Practice:**
- [`module-01/terraform/basics/`](../../module-01/terraform/basics/) - Terraform fundamentals lab
- [`module-01/terraform/examples/`](../../module-01/terraform/examples/) - Example configurations
- [`module-01/terraform/exercises/`](../../module-01/terraform/exercises/) - Practice exercises

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed ([Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))
- AWS Account ([Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)) - optional, can use LocalStack
- Terraform installed ([Download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html))
- AWS CLI configured (for LocalStack practice)
